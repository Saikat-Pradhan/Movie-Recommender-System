## 🚀 Project Overview

### This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning similarity techniques can recommend movies based on their content.

### The system analyzes movie metadata such as:

- Genres
- Keywords
- Cast
- Crew
- Overview

### Users simply select a movie, and the system generates personalized recommendations along with movie posters.

- Movie recommendation based on similarity
- Content-Based Filtering approach
- NLP-based feature engineering
- Cosine Similarity algorithm
- Movie poster fetching using TMDB API
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Fast real-time recommendations
- Deployed on Streamlit Cloud

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Streamlit 🌐
- Scikit-learn ⚙️
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🧠
- CountVectorizer
- Cosine Similarity

## 📊 Dataset

### Dataset used from Kaggle: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

👉 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata

### The project uses two datasets provided by TMDB (The Movie Database):

#### 1️⃣ tmdb_5000_movies.csv

- Movie Title
- Genres
- Keywords
- Overview
- Popularity
- Vote Average
- Movie ID
- Release Date
- Runtime

#### 2️⃣ tmdb_5000_credits.csv

- Movie ID
- Cast Information
- Crew Information (Director, Producer, etc.)

## 🏗️ Model Training

Model development performed in:

📓 Movie_Recommender_System.ipynb

- Training Pipeline
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Extraction
- Tags Creation
- Text Vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Vector Transformation
- Cosine Similarity Calculation
- Model Serialization using Pickle

---

## Saved Files
- movies.pkl              → Processed movie dataset
- CountVectorizer.pkl     → Trained vectorizer

---

## 🧠 How the App Works

- User selects a movie from dropdown.
- Movie metadata is converted into vectors.
- Cosine similarity is calculated between movies.
- Top 5 similar movies are selected.
- Posters are fetched using TMDB API.
- Recommended movies are displayed visually.
